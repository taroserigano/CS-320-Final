### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- In order to ensure your code meets all requirements and practical user cases,
you would have to test every possible case that can happen in the application to 
see if the application properly reacts or behaves in every possible situation and setting. 
Also, you'd have to every circumstance that each function results. That includes
AssertEqual() both True and False reactions and not just one way around.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- In order to properly incorporate user needs, you would have to carefully
collect their reqreuiments. This becomes a first important step
that is followed by creating a design document that needs to cover
all the requirements requested by the client. 

### How do I approach designing software?

- For designing the software, there are three fundamental steps you should perform when you have a program to write:

1. Define the output and data flows.
2. Develop the logic to get to that output.
3. Write the program.

The important part is that actual code implementation starts at the last step but
this actually explains why software design needs to be carefully planned and
created even before starting writing code.
